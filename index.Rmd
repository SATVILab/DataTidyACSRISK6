# Introduction
  
The goal of DataTidyACSRISK6 is to make the ACS RISK6 data available.

The processing is actually performed in `FredHutch/TuberculomicsCompendium`, but that package is at present restricted to Tuberculomics members and so we make available the RISK6 dataset from there here for in-SATVI use.
